We are very pleased to got our grant proposal to Innosuisse accepted early
this year.
On the 7th of April 2025 we officially started work on the grant called
`Secure and Privacy-Preserving Credentials for E-ID` with the Innosuisse
ID `101.292 IP-ICT`.
Throughout the grant, we want to publish every 2 weeks a short post presenting
our latest findings.
